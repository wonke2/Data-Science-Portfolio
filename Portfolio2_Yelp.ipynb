    "The portfolio aims to use various data processing techniques to clean and preprocess the data, filter out irrelevant data, and remove any outliers that could impact the accuracy of the model. Finally, the portfolio aims to use linear regression models to train and validate the model's accuracy in predicting user ratings towards business. Ultimately, the objective is to build a reliable model that can be used to provide insights into user preferences and help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve their services and offerings. In this task, we will explore the impacts of feature selections and different sizes of training/testing data on the model performance. We will use Yelp sub-dataset."
